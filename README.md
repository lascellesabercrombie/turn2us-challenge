# turn2us-challenge

## Summary

Technical test for (turn2us)[https://www.turn2us.org.uk/] with a page that allows user to verify their age and directs them to a new page informing them of their eligibility on the basis of their answer. 

## User Stories

* I want to know if I am eligible to apply for benefits
* As an 18-year-old applicant, I want to receive confirmation that I am eligible 
* As a 17-year-old applicant, I want to be told if benefits are possible for me. If not, I want to be told when I will be eligible and pointed to other resources. 
* As a visually impaired user, I want to be able to navigate all parts of the website

## Design

Using font and colours from the turn2us website

## Possible Further Steps

* Further division between under-16 and 16-18, to further clarify what benefits are available. 
* More styling (making sure it works for mobile and desktop)
* Allow user to input date of birth then calculate age from that information.
